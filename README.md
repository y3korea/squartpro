# AI SmartSquat Pro üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

AI SmartSquat Pro is an advanced squat analysis and feedback system built using Streamlit, Mediapipe, and OpenCV. It provides real-time squat form analysis and voice feedback to help users perform exercises with correct form, enhancing their workout experience and safety.

## Features
- Real-time squat form analysis and feedback
- Voice feedback for guiding squat posture and corrections
- Skeleton visualization and joint angle calculation
- Customizable calibration for personalized workout guidance
- Intuitive user interface with live video feed and feedback display

## How It Works
1. **Calibration**: Perform 5 squats to establish baseline angles and target zones.
2. **Workout**: Analyze squat form in real-time, receiving immediate feedback on posture, joint angles, and completion status.
3. **Voice Feedback**: Provides auditory guidance, signaling correct form or suggesting corrections as necessary.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/y3korea/squartpro.git
   cd squartpro

Requirements

	‚Ä¢	Python 3.7 or higher
	‚Ä¢	Webcam for video feed
	‚Ä¢	Speakers or headphones for voice feedback

Usage

	‚Ä¢	Start Calibration: Begin by performing 5 squats to set your baseline.
	‚Ä¢	Camera Check: Verify your camera feed is working.
	‚Ä¢	Start Workout: Begin the workout, and the application will monitor your squat form.
	‚Ä¢	Stop: End the workout session and release resources.
